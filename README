This module may be used in two ways:
     a) It implements (exported) function spawn which starts a process
     	asyncroneously (as fork/exec on *nix, but without overhead on
     	systems with native spawn()ing);
     b) It implements run-trees which may be used instead of starting shell
     	to run compicated commands.
     	
(Some tests still fail on some platforms.)
