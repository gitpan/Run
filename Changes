Revision history for Perl extension Run.

0.01  Thu Dec 18 14:50:57 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02:	Initial release (chain, or, and, pipe, env, redir).
	Redir very fragile in complicated situations (tests 10-13 may fail
	depending on what fd were used when started).

0.03:	fdopen() is in fact ">&=FOO", thus close of created filehandle
	invalidates FOO.  Changed to open().

	Some tests still do not work right.
